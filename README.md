# how-to-make-a-to-do-list

This project is about how to create a todo list. In this todo list, you can create todos and when you complete any todo, you can select them as completed by 
clicking on them. Also, you can delete your todos. Your todos will be kept by a localStorage (including the completed phase of your todos). 
Have fun!
